# Global Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a global weather dataset collected from various regions worldwide, available on Kaggle. The dataset includes comprehensive weather metrics such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and air quality indices across different locations and time zones. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forecasting models, and feature importance analysis to provide insights into global weather patterns and develop predictive models for temperature forecasting.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
- **World Weather Repository**: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/code)
- **File**: `GlobalWeatherRepository.csv`
- **Size**: 24,442 entries
- **Features**: 41 columns, including weather metrics (temperature, wind speed, precipitation), air quality indices, and celestial data (sunrise, sunset, moon phase).

## Installation

To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/global-weather-analysis.git
    cd global-weather-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install necessary libraries**: Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `seaborn`
    - `statsmodels`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `plotly`

    You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn plotly
    ```

4. **Download the dataset**:
    Download the dataset from Kaggle: [World Weather Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/code)

5. **Place the dataset**:
   Place the `GlobalWeatherRepository.csv` file in the appropriate directory as specified in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch the notebook and open the file containing the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   You should see a file called `global_weather_forecasting_bhavana.ipynb`. Open it to explore the weather analysis.

2. **Run the cells**:
   Execute each cell sequentially in the notebook to run the analysis.

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers in temperature and air quality indices.
- Scaled continuous features and encoded categorical features such as wind direction and weather conditions.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Temperature Distribution**: Showed global temperature distribution, with most locations ranging from 20°C to 35°C.
- **Precipitation Analysis**: Explored minimal rainfall across regions, except for outliers where heavy rainfall was recorded.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlighted relationships between variables, such as the negative correlation between temperature and humidity.

### 3. Time Series Analysis
- **Daily Averages**: Resampled data to show daily temperature and precipitation trends.
- **Decomposition**: Identified trend and seasonal components for temperature data.

### 4. Forecasting Models
- **ARIMA**: Forecasted temperature trends, achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.97.
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Best-performing model with an RMSE of 0.99.
- **Ensemble Model**: Combined ARIMA, ETS, and SMA forecasts for an ensemble RMSE of 1.14.

### 5. Feature Importance
- **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Ranked humidity, pressure, and ozone levels as the most important features for predicting temperature.

### 6. Geospatial and Spatial Analysis
- **Temperature Map**: A scatter map visualized global temperature patterns, with the hottest regions in the Middle East and the coldest in Australia and Chile during winter.
- **Country-wise Comparison**: A bar chart compared average temperatures across countries, highlighting the hottest and coldest regions.

## Results
- **Best Forecasting Model**: The Simple Moving Average (SMA) model performed best for temperature prediction.
- **Important Features**: Humidity and pressure were the key factors in predicting temperature, with moderate influence from ozone levels.
- **Geographical Insights**: The Middle East had extreme heat, while Southern Hemisphere countries like Australia experienced colder temperatures during winter.

## Future Work
- **Model Tuning**: Further exploration of ARIMA and ETS models to improve temperature forecasting accuracy.
- **Feature Expansion**: Including additional variables like solar radiation or atmospheric moisture could improve model performance.
- **Climate Analysis**: A longitudinal study could provide insights into global warming and environmental changes.
